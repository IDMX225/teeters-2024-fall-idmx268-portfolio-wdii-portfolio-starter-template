    <p>Basing the poem off a card template provided to us, we developed a unique card-sized poem site. With the poem I chose, I felt that I could base it around the image that appeared at the top of the card. I decided to go with a blue color scheme because I felt it represented the sky that a hiker would be seeing when they are faced with a fork in the road.</p>
<p>It took a bit of finagling to get the card to look exactly the way I want it, as I did have some issues with the changes I was making not sticking. But once I figured out that issue with some help from the Professor, the rest of the card came together quite nicely for me. Overall, I liked how this poem site looked a bit more than the first one.</p>
