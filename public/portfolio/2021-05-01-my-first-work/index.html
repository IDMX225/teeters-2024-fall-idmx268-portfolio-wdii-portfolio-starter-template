    <p>We did this website first, and I thought I could get good imagery with the "Trees" poem. It took some time and editing to get the website just the way I like it, but it is in a place that I am satisfied with. The only issue that I had was, when I attempted to fix the text (as I was told the cursive made it a bit hard to read originally) it kept reverting to Comic Sans. However, I felt that it was much more legible with this font so I decided to keep it as a placeholder for the website.</p>
<p>Otherwise the updating of the website went well, I believe. I was able to make the website more responsive for mobile. I went back into the code and fixed some issues regarding the HTML. I also adjusted the file name of the photos, which I realized were labeled incorrectly on my first go-round of creating the website.</p>
